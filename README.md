Our team's final report for CPSC 436A (Operating Systems Design and Implementation).

From https://tfjmp.org/UBC-CPSC-436A/:

> The course covers the design and implementation of various operating systems concepts such as memory management, scheduling, inter-process communication, inter-core synchronization, protection, device drivers, file systems, and networking. Moreover, the course pays particular attention to the design of system software architectures that differ from the traditional monolithic arrangements of Unix/Linux and Windows.
